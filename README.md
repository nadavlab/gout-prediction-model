# Gout Prediction Calculator

This program predicts the probability of a patient developing gout based on their demographic and medical parameters.

## Research Overview

This prediction model is based on the research article titled "A machine learning-based prediction model for gout in hyperuricemics â€“ a nationwide cohort study" by Shay Brikman et al. A retrospective nationwide Israeli cohort study used the Clalit Health Insurance database of 473,124 individuals to identify adults 18 years or older with at least two serum urate measurements exceeding 6.8 mg/dL between January 2007 and December 2022Patients with a prior gout diagnosis or on gout medications were excluded.

Patients' demographic characteristics, community and hospital diagnoses, routine medication prescriptions, and laboratory results were used to train a risk prediction model. 

A machine learning model, XGBoost, was developed to predict the risk of gout. Feature selection methods were used to identify relevant variables. The model's performance was evaluated using the receiver operating characteristic area under the curve (ROC AUC) and precision-recall AUC.

The primary outcome was the diagnosis of gout among hyperuricemic patients. 

Among the 301,385 participants with hyperuricemia included in the analysis, 15,055 (5%) were diagnosed with gout. The XGBoost model had a ROC-AUC of 0.781 (95% CI 0.78-0.784) and precision-recall AUC of 0.208 (95% CI 0.195-0.22). 
The most significant variables associated with gout diagnosis were serum uric acid levels, age, hyperlipidemia, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and diuretic purchases. A compact model using only these five variables yielded a ROC-AUC of 0.714 (95% CI 0.706-0.723) and a negative predictive value (NPV) of 95%.

## Libraries Required

- Python==3.x
- pandas
- joblib==1.4.0
- xgboost

## How to Run

1. Ensure you have Python 3.x installed on your system.
2. Install the required libraries by running: `pip install pandas joblib xgboost`.
3. Download or clone the repository to your local machine.
4. Open a terminal or command prompt.
5. Navigate to the directory containing the `main.py` file.
6. Run the following command:

    ```
    python main.py -age <age> -ua <serum urate level> -hyperlipidemia <True/False> -nsaid <True/False> -diuretic <True/False>
    ```

    Replace `<age>` with the patient's age, `<serum urate level>` with the patient's serum urate level (mg/dL), and `<True/False>` with the corresponding values for hyperlipidemia, NSAID usage, and diuretic usage.

7. The program will print the predicted probability of the patient developing gout.
